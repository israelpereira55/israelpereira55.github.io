## _About me_

<p align="justify">A brief about me because nobody likes too much text: I'm a researcher who loves optimization. I'm currently doing a PhD in Computer Science at UFF.</p>


*   <p align="justify">I have 2 years of professional experience developing aerial autonomous vehicles. My work is focused on the route planning, path planning, and smooth trajectories.</p>
*    <p align="justify">I have 1,5 years of professional experience working with computer vision, object detection, and tracking. I have vastly worked with neural networks such as YoLo and EfficientNet, and major development using OpenCV, C++, and Python.</p>
*    <p align="justify">I'm always searching for the best techniques and strategies in literature. I also try to collaborate with my strategies in the projects.</p>
*    <p align="justify">I have proposed a state-of-the-art algorithm to solve the CVRP. The paper was published among the 10 best journals ranked on Scopus that year. The algorithm is called CDELS and is given open-source!</p>


<p align="justify">I mostly use C, C++, and Python in my projects. Here are also my papers, and if they are out of the embargo period, I will present the manuscript version =).</p>

## _Experience_

* [**Optimization Developer and Artificial Intelligence Developer**] | [Motora Tecnologia]  
[_February/2022 - August/2024_]  
_Research and software development in autonomous vehicles. Work in collaboration with EMBRAER for the eVTOL development. My work is focused on optimization techniques and development of the route planning, path planning, and smooth trajectories for autonomous aerial vehicles._

_The project was also presented in the news:_ [link](https://tribunaonline.com.br/economia/tecnologia-capixaba-no-carro-voador-da-embraer-139290).
_As in the news, the vehicle will cost R$ 14,9 million, and 250 units were already sold in May/24._


* [**Computer Vision Developer**] | [_Start Tech Solução em Tecnologia LTDA_]  
[_January/2020 - June/2021_]  
_Research and software development of computer vision. I entered as a Junior but I quickly became the primary developer of the company, being the major responsible in the systems development and deliverement.

_I've developed many systems that use both neural networks, graph theory, and optimization algorithms for real-time applications using neural networks such as YoLo, EfficientNet, and tracking (with my optimization techniques and that was the best part!). Also, as an optimization lover, I really enjoyed looking for state-of-the-art techniques to improve the model's performance and achieve better training.</p>

_Major skills: TensorFlow, C++, Python, YoLo, EfficientNet, Pandas, Numpy._


* [**Intern**] | [_Start Tech Solução em Tecnologia LTDA_]

## _Some cool projects_

> CDELS: a state-of-the-art algorithm based on Differential Evolution with Local Search for the CVRP

_Language: C_  
CDELS is given open-source: [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650223000196), [source code](https://github.com/israelpereira55/CDELS).  
CDELS is a robust algorithm to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with outstanding performance. It is an old code, but I plan to bring an updated modern C++ version!


> RGRASP+VND: a Reactive GRASP algorithm for the Multi-depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows

_Language: Python_  
Also [open-source](https://github.com/israelpereira55/MDVRPTW)! =)

## _Awards_

> Winner Startup: Agrofácil

<p align="justify">In just one semester we have created a startup for online invoice emission for rural workers because in a few years online emission for rural workers would become mandatory in our country. We achieved first place in the event, obtaining U$10 thousand dollars in Amazon services, among free consultancy services and other prizes.</p>
