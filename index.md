## _About me_

<p align="justify">A brief about me because nobody likes too much text: I'm a researcher who loves optimization. I'm currently doing a PhD in Computer Science at UFF.</p>

<p align="justify">Currently, I work with autonomous aerial vehicles focused on the route, path planning, and smooth trajectories. I'm always looking for the best strategies in literature and I also bring my optimization techniques as much as I can.</p> 

The project was also presented in the news: [link](https://tribunaonline.com.br/economia/tecnologia-capixaba-no-carro-voador-da-embraer-139290).
As in the news, the vehicle will cost R$ 14,9 million, and 250 units were already sold in May/24.
  
<p align="justify">I also enjoy computer vision and have two years of professional experience. Out of a bunch of works that I can't tell, I've developed many systems that use both neural networks, graph theory, and optimization algorithms for real-time applications using neural networks such as YoLo, EfficientNet, and tracking (with my optimization techniques and that was the best part!). Also, as an optimization lover, I really enjoyed looking for state-of-the-art techniques to improve the model's performance and achieve better training.</p>

<p align="justify">My research is mostly about optimization algorithms and meta-heuristics. Lately, I have been able to propose a state-of-the-art algorithm for the CVRP in conjunction with my supervisors. The paper was published among the ten best-ranked journals in Computer Science on the Scopus ranking that year. The algorithm is called CDELS and it was also published open-source! =D</p>

<p align="justify">I mostly use C, C++, and Python. Here are also my papers, and if they are out of the embargo period, I will present the manuscript version =).</p>

## _Some cool projects_

> CDELS: a state-of-the-art algorithm based in Differential Evolution with Local Search for the CVRP

_Language: C_  
CDELS is given open-source: [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650223000196), [source code](https://github.com/israelpereira55/CDELS).  
CDELS is a robust algorithm to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with outstanding performance. It is an old code, but I plan to bring an updated modern c++ version!


> RGRASP+VND: a Reactive GRASP algorithm for the Multi-depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows

_Language: Python_  
Also [open-source](https://github.com/israelpereira55/MDVRPTW)! =)
